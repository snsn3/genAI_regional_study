# Contributing to GenAI Regional Study

Thank you for your interest in this project. This repository accompanies an academic study on LLM regional bias; contributions that improve reproducibility, documentation, or code clarity are welcome.

## How to contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and create a branch from `main` for your changes.
2. **Keep changes focused** — one logical change per branch (e.g. fix a bug, add a notebook, improve docs).
3. **Respect the data** — do not alter the original shared datasets; propose new derived files or scripts if needed.
4. **Document code** — add brief comments or markdown in notebooks so that others can follow the analysis.
5. **Open a Pull Request** with a short description of what you changed and why.

## Code and data

- **Notebooks** should run from the repository root so that paths to `*.csv` files work as in the README.
- **New dependencies** should be added to `requirements.txt` with a version constraint.
- **Citation**: if you use this code or data in a paper, please cite the publication and this repo as described in [README.md](README.md#citation).

## Questions
